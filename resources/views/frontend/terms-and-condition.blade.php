                        <p>
                            The booking is considered confirmed once Aqua Splash has verbally accepted the booking on
                            site or has issued a written confirmation, receipt or invoice. This includes email and
                            website confirmation if booked online. Once a booking has been confirmed, the Participant
                            will have an allocated date and time. The Participant must advise Aqua Splash within 24
                            hours of making the booking if there is any mistake in this booking confirmation. Aqua
                            Splash will exercise all reasonable endeavours to ensure that the Participant and the
                            Participant’s party’s allocated activity commences at the time booked and it shall be the
                            responsibility of the Participant to ensure they arrive in sufficient time. Late arrivals
                            may not be permitted to undertake the activity booked and no refunds or compensation will
                            be payable in such circumstances.

                            Participants should arrive at least 45 minutes before they are due to commence their
                            Activities to get kitted out and for the safety briefings. This is essential as Activities
                            have a limited capacity and delays to the start can cause further delays for participants
                            throughout that day.<br><br>
                            If a participant misses the start time due to reasons outside their control, then it will
                            be at the discretion of the Manager on duty as to whether the late arrival can be
                            accommodated. No refunds or partial refunds will be made for late arriving participants.
